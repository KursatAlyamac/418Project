Key changes made:
Added a new obstacle avoidance head with similar architecture to the powerup detection head
The obstacle head produces a heatmap of potential obstacles (bananas, etc.)
Combined the path planning with obstacle avoidance by multiplying the path logits with an inverse obstacle probability map
This causes the network to reduce path probabilities in areas where obstacles are detected
