These changes add:
Learning rate scheduling that reduces the learning rate when training plateaus
Action smoothing to prevent jerky steering
Enhanced drift control with recovery behavior
Dynamic steering gain that adapts to speed and turn sharpness
Velocity control that adjusts for turns
Smart nitro usage with recovery periods
Progressive acceleration and braking
L1 regularization during training
The controller now maintains state between calls, allowing it to implement smoother transitions and recovery behaviors. The learning rate scheduler will help training converge to better solutions by reducing the learning rate when progress stalls.


Modifications after failed test:

Key improvements to address understeer:

Enhanced Steering Response:
Increased base steering gain from 6 to 8
Reduced smoothing factor from 0.3 to 0.2 for more responsive steering
More aggressive dynamic steering gain scaling with turn sharpness

Better Turn Speed Control:
More aggressive speed reduction in turns (70% reduction vs previous 50%)
Earlier braking when approaching sharp turns
Reduced acceleration during turns

Improved Drift Behavior:
Lower threshold for initiating drifts
Added drift cooldown to prevent rapid drift toggling
Less aggressive acceleration reduction during drifts
Shorter recovery period after drifts

Turn Detection and Response:
More sensitive turn detection
More aggressive braking response to sharp turns
Conservative nitro usage in turns
