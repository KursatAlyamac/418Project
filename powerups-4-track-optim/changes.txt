The key changes made are:

Added a TrackOptimizer class that:
Samples and interpolates track points for smoother path planning
Finds optimal trajectory points ahead of the kart
Calculates target steering points considering track curvature

Modified the Planner to:
Initialize track optimizer
Blend CNN predictions with track-based optimization when world state is available
Fall back to pure CNN predictions when no world state is available

The track optimizer helps by:
Providing a more stable and predictable racing line
Considering track width and curvature for better cornering
Allowing look-ahead planning for smoother trajectories
