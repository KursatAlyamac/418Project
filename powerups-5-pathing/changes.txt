These changes add:
A new RacingLinePredictor module that learns optimal racing lines through the track
Integration of racing line features with the path planning head
Additional loss terms for racing line prediction during training
The racing line predictor uses a series of convolutional layers to extract racing line features that are combined with the path planning features
