Key improvements made:

Deeper Architecture: Added an additional convolutional layer (conv4) to extract more complex features.

Enhanced Feature Processing: Increased the number of residual blocks from 2 to 3 for better feature refinement.

Multi-Scale Attention: Replaced the simple spatial attention with a new MultiScaleAttention module that:
Processes features at different scales (1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 convolutions)
Combines multi-scale information for better path understanding
Helps detect both fine details and broader road features

Improved Path Planning Head: Enhanced the path_conv module with a sequential structure including batch normalization and additional convolution.

Larger Initial Kernel: Changed the first convolution to use a 5x5 kernel to capture more spatial context from the start.

These changes should help the kart:
Follow smoother racing lines by better understanding the track geometry
Make more consistent decisions due to the multi-scale feature processing
Handle turns more effectively due to the improved spatial understanding
Maintain more stable behavior through the deeper architecture
