# SuperTuxKart Project 

 This is our repository containing all of the code we have worked on to try and get the best results possible in this program. We have folders that each contain different developments for our code. Our folders are named based on the advances that each one made. 

 default-codebase: The original codebase provided with our personal controller written
 early_trials: Very first trials made when starting the project. Changes range from image amount inputs, CNN layers, controller changes, and hyperparameterization
 modified_cnns: Successful changes using dropout layers, pooling, etc.
 advanced_pathing: Attempts to try and create the best possible pathing
 powerups_versions: Obstacle detection, racing line prediction, enhanced neural network
 cart_ddpg: A RL implementation for controller acceleration utilizing double q learning
 best_results: The overall best results are stored here. There are two trials, one with more epochs and one with less epochs. Utilizes powerups, modified_cnn, and advanced_pathing codes to produce the best results
