Key improvements made:

CNN Architecture:
Added residual blocks for better feature extraction
Implemented spatial attention for path planning
Enhanced powerup detection with deeper network and batch normalization
Added dropout for regularization
Reduced kernel sizes for better detail preservation

Training Process:
Added pos_weight to BCEWithLogitsLoss to handle class imbalance in powerup detection
Implemented cosine annealing learning rate schedule with warmup
Added progressive weighting for powerup loss
Improved gradient clipping
Separated path and powerup loss tracking
