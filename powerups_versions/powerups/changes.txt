Key improvements made:

Planner (CNN):
Added a deeper network with more channels for better feature extraction
Introduced a separate powerup detection head
Uses multiple convolutional layers with increasing receptive fields

Controller:
Dynamic steering gain based on speed
Adaptive target velocity based on turn sharpness
Improved nitro usage on straightaways
Better drift control with speed management during drifts
More aggressive acceleration/braking thresholds

Training:
Added powerup detection loss
Maintained compatibility with existing training data
Better loss tracking and visualization

The planner now returns both aim_point and powerup detection
The controller makes better use of racing techniques like drifting and nitro
Target velocity has been increased to 30 (from 25) since the controller is more sophisticated
