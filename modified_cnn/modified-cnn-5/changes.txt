Key improvements made:

Architecture Changes:
Added a larger initial kernel (7x7) to capture more spatial information
Implemented proper residual blocks with skip connections
Added global average pooling to reduce spatial dimensions
Increased network depth and width with more channels

Performance Optimizations:
Used inplace=True for ReLU operations to save memory    
Added adaptive average pooling for better feature aggregation
Increased dropout rate to 0.3 for better regularization

Feature Extraction:
Progressive channel increase (64 → 128 → 256) for better feature hierarchy
Added 1x1 convolutions for channel reduction
Maintained skip connections for better gradient flow
