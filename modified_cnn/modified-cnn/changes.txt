Key improvements made:
Increased initial filters from 16 to 32 to capture more features
Added average pooling after first conv layer to reduce spatial dimensions while maintaining important features
Added an intermediate conv layer with 3x3 kernel to better process spatial relationships
Kept the final 1x1 conv layer to produce the heatmap

The changes:
Use more filters initially (32 instead of 16) to capture richer features
Added AvgPool2d to help with spatial dimension reduction and feature aggregation
Added an intermediate conv layer with 3x3 kernel for better feature processing
Maintained small parameter count while improving network capacity
